Writing and Reading
-------------------

This part shows how to write and read files with rgmol.


Writing and reading eigenmodes
******************************

After the computation of the eigenmodes of a kernel, the eigenmodes will be saved by default.

The molecule.plot_diagonalized_kernel will also look if the eigenmodes have already been calculated.

In order to recompute the eigenmodes, one can use the try_reading keyword. And if one do not want to save the eigenmodes, one can use the save keyword.

More information on the keywords can be found :doc:`here<../plot/plot_diagonalized_kernel>`.

They will be saved in the rgmol folder see :doc:`here<../data_structure>` for more information.

Writing cube files
******************

One can use the method :doc:`molecule.write_cube<../write/write_cube>` to write a cube file containing a certain vector.

This file can then be reextracted using the :doc:`rgmol.extract_cube.extract<../extract_cube/extract>` or :doc:`rgmol.extract_cube.extract<../extract_cube/extract_properties>` functions.
