Quick Start
===========


Importing
---------

In order to use rgmol, one needs to import it using::

  import rgmol
  

Atom Objects
------------

In rgmol, the atoms are objects that contain multiple attributes such as :
 * atomic_number
 * name (element name)
 * pos (the position)
 * properties (a dict containing various properties such as the radius used for plotting)
 
The following code presents how to create and view the attributes of an atom ::

  >>> import rgmol
  >>> Carbon = rgmol.atom("C", [0.0,0.0,0.0])
  >>> Carbon.atomic_number
  6
  >>> Carbon.name
  'C'
  >>> Hydrogen = rgmol.atom(1, [0.0,0.0,0.0])
  >>> Hydrogen.name
  'H'
  >>> Hydrogen.atomic_number
  1
  >>> Carbon.pos
  [0.0,0.0,0.0]
  >>> Carbon.properties
  {'radius': 0.99}
  >>> Carbon.properties["electronegativity"] = 2.55
  >>> Carbon.properties
  {'electronegativity':2.55, 'radius': 0.99}
  
More details concerning atom objects can be found :doc:`here<objects/atom>`.

Molecules Objects
-----------------

Molecules, such as atoms are objects introduced by rgmol. They contain the following attributes ::

 * atoms (the list of the atoms in the molecule)
 * bonds (the list of the bonds between the atoms)
 * properties (a dict containing various properties of the molecule such as Molecular Orbitals arrays

The bonds list contains lists of 3 integers : [position in the list of atom 1, position in the list of atom 2, order of the bond]
 
The following code presents how to create and view the attributes of a dihydrogen molecule ::

  >>> import rgmol
  >>> H_1 = rgmol.atom(1, [0.0,0.0,0.0])
  >>> H_2 = rgmol.atom("H", [1.0,0.0,0.0])
  >>> Dihydrogen = rgmol.molecule([H_1,H_2], [0,1,1])
  >>> Dihydrogen.atoms[0].name
  'H'
  >>> Dihydrogen.atoms[1].pos
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  >>> Dihydrogen.bonds
  [0, 1, 1]
  >>> Dihydrogen.properties["condensed function"] = [1.0, 0.0]
  >>> Dihydrogen.list_properties()
  ["condensed function"]
  >>> Dihydrogen.list_property("radius")
  array([0.83, 0.83])
 
More details concerning molecules can be found :doc:`here<objects/molecule>`.


Extracting Data from Calculation Outputs
----------------------------------------

Because it is tedious to import manually each atoms to construct a molecule, it is possible to extact data from calculation outputs.
One just needs to use the following command ::
  
  molecule = rgmol.extract_<calculation_output_type>.extract(file)
  
The supported DFT calculation outputs are :
 * ADF ::
 
    molecule = rgmol.extract_adf.extract(file)
 
 * Orca ::
 
     molecule = rgmol.extract_orca.extract(file)
   
 * Molden files ::
 
     molecule = rgmol.extract_molden.extract(file)

 * Cube files ::
 
     molecule = rgmol.extract_cube.extract(file)

Adding data from Calculation Outputs to a Molecule
--------------------------------------------------

It is also possible to add data from calculation to a molecule using the following functions ::

  * Isodensity from a cube file ::
  
    rgmol.extract_cube.extract_properties(file,mol=molecule)

  * Atomic Orbitals and Molecular Orbitals ::
    
	rgmol.extract_molden.extract_properties(file,mol=molecule)
	
  * Transition densities and dipole moments ::
  
    rgmol.extract_orac.extract_properties(file,mol=molecule)


Plotting Molecules
------------------

In order to plot molecules, one should choose the python package used for visualization.

In order to simply plot the molecule, one needs to do ::

  molecule.plot_radius()
  
The following commands is a detailed script that show a Chloromethane molecule from an ADF example output. The list of examples can be found :doc:`here<examples>`.


.. pyvista-plot::
   
   import rgmol
   import rgmol.examples
  
   file = rgmol.examples.adf_CH3Cl
   mol = rgmol.extract_adf.extract(file)
   mol.plot_radius()

Plotting Multiple Molecules
---------------------------

One can plot multiple molecules using the group molecules object.
They are built using a list of molecules.

.. pyvista-plot::
   
   import rgmol
   import rgmol.examples
  
   list_molecules = []
  
   file = rgmol.examples.adf_CH4
   mol = rgmol.extract_adf.extract(file)
   list_molecules.append(mol)
   
   file2 = rgmol.examples.adf_CH3Cl
   mol2 = rgmol.extract_adf.extract(file2)
   list_molecules.append(mol2)
   
   group_mol = rgmol.group_molecules(list_molecules)
   group_mol.plot_radius()
